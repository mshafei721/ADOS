## 🔧 Fixes Applied During Testing

### 1. Configuration System Enhancement
- **Issue**: Missing `default_config.yaml`
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive YAML config with 9 sections
- **Result**: Full configuration loading capability

### 2. Memory Coordinator API Compatibility
- **Issue**: Missing async `store_data` and `retrieve_data` methods
- **Solution**: Added async interface methods with JSON serialization
- **Result**: Full memory operation compatibility

### 3. Orchestrator Tools Implementation
- **Issue**: Missing `tools/orchestrator_tools.py` file
- **Solution**: Implemented 3 essential tools with fallback mechanisms
- **Result**: Complete tool integration and functionality
