## Recent Completion

### Phase 2 - Task 2.4: Logging Infrastructure Setup ✅
**Completed**: 2025-07-16
**Components Implemented**:
- JSON logging formatters with structured data support
- Central logging service with configuration management
- Log rotation handlers with compression support
- Performance monitoring with metrics collection
- Crew-specific logging utilities
- Comprehensive test suite

**Files Created**:
- `tools/logging/formatters.py` - JSON formatting utilities
- `tools/logging/handlers.py` - Custom rotating handlers
- `tools/logging/crew_logger.py` - Crew-specific utilities
- `orchestrator/logging_service.py` - Central logging service
- `orchestrator/performance_monitor.py` - Performance tracking
- `tests/test_logging_infrastructure.py` - Test suite

**Integration Points**:
- Updated `orchestrator/main.py` to use new logging service
- System configured per `system_settings.json` specifications
- All components working with JSON output format
- Log rotation configured (10MB/5 files)
- Performance monitoring operational

## Next Steps
- Begin task assignment from main planning
- Start crew-specific work execution
- Maintain progress synchronization with main tracking
