# Agent Task Queue - Runtime Workspace

## Overview
This file serves as the active task queue for agent crews during runtime. Tasks are decomposed by the orchestrator from the system memory and assigned to specific crews.

## Task Status Legend

## Runtime Task Management
- Tasks are decomposed by orchestrator from system memory (./memory/)
- Each crew has a dedicated workspace folder for runtime files
- Crew-specific context is maintained in ./workspace/[crew_name]/
- Final outputs are generated to ./output/ by orchestrator
- System memory (./memory/) contains persistent knowledge and context
