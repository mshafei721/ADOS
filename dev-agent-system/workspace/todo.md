## Runtime Task Management
- Tasks are decomposed by orchestrator from system memory (./memory/)
- Each crew has a dedicated workspace folder for runtime files
- Crew-specific context is maintained in ./workspace/[crew_name]/
- Final outputs are generated to ./output/ by orchestrator
- System memory (./memory/) contains persistent knowledge and context
